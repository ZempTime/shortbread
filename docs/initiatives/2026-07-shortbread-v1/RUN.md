# Run Manifest

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Run | `2026-07-18-shortbread-v1` |
| Work item | [ZempTime/shortbread](https://github.com/ZempTime/shortbread); direct design and authority conversation |
| Initializer | Claude Code on Claude Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`) |
| Current controller | Codex delivery-replan controller (`ZempTime`) |
| Accepted doctrine baseline | Repo-local MWP with bounded campaigns, fresh-context leaf units, TDD, proportionate independent review, durable pause/recovery, and explicit credential boundary |
| Repository authority | Implement, review, repair, document, package, and prepare deployment of the accepted Shortbread v1 scope |
| External authority | Configure the GitHub issue tracker; create/update issues, branches, commits, pull requests, releases, packages, and deployment configuration inside `ZempTime/shortbread` as required by the goal |
| Initialized | 2026-07-18 |
| State token | `delivery-replan-publication-pending` |
| Current state | Product execution is paused. Stage 05 has a locally reviewed bounded delivery graph; interrupted branches are remote-durable; GitHub leaf publication/reconciliation is the only active coordination work |

## Stage Status

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 00 Framing | Complete | [Framing contract](00_framing/output/2026-07-18-framing-contract.md), draft PRD, glossary, and ADRs |
| 01 Spec | Complete | [Canonical PRD](01_spec/output/2026-07-18-shortbread-v1-prd.md) / [GitHub #1](https://github.com/ZempTime/shortbread/issues/1) |

| 03 Whole-goal handoff | Historical; superseded | [`GOAL.md`](03_goal_handoff/output/GOAL.md) is retained but must not be relaunched |
| 04 Original execution | Paused after interrupted attempt | #2 integrated; #3/#4 partial branch evidence preserved under [`04_execution/`](04_execution/) |
| 05 Delivery replan | Reviewed locally; publication pending | [Bounded campaign/unit graph](05_delivery_replan/output/2026-07-20-delivery-plan.md), [unit contract](05_delivery_replan/output/UNIT-CONTRACT.md), and [tracker](05_delivery_replan/output/tracker.md) |
| 99 Harvest | Complete for setup and #2; interrupted-run learning promoted into MWP | [Setup harvest](99_harvest/output/2026-07-18-goal-setup-harvest.md) plus Stage 05 process corrections |

## Recovery Capsule

| Field | State |
|---|---|
| Reconciled | 2026-07-20, after remote preservation and local graph review |
| Integration branch/head | `main` / `119c6c4` before this coordination change; product code baseline includes merged #2 at `f2e0326` |
| Release candidate | `ticket-3-releases-rollback` local and remote at `f5943d7`; no PR/review target yet |
| Auth source evidence | `ticket-4-owner-cli-auth` local and remote at `8fcb22f`; no PR; replay semantically only after U01 |
| Worktrees | Old `/private/tmp/shortbread-ticket-{3,4}` paths are missing/prunable and are not recovery sources |
| Dirty state | Coordination files for Stage 05 are being authored on `main`; no product implementation is active |
| Collision | Both preserved branches edit `config/routes.rb`; Release branch removes `db/schema.rb` for SQL structure dumps while auth branch edits it |
| Dependency state | Frozen/audited at `3c40a67`; manifest/lock/tool changes require ADR 0007 exception |
| Review state | None for the new graph; old ticket #2 verdict remains historical evidence |
| Reserved surfaces | Root run/tracker/factory docs are exclusive to this replan controller until publication completes |
| True stop | Product-scope/trust/authority change, preservation failure, or unreconcilable tracker mutation—not ordinary graph edits |
| Next action | Publish Stage 05 leaf issues in dependency order, reconcile #3–#17 as umbrellas, make only U01 `ready-for-agent`, then emit a fresh-context campaign-ready capsule |

## Campaign Model

- The initiative persists through v1; one `ship-goal` controller owns one campaign of at most four leaf integrations.
- The [Stage 05 delivery plan](05_delivery_replan/output/2026-07-20-delivery-plan.md) is canonical for executable units and edges.
- The original issues #3–#17 own acceptance history; Stage 05 leaves own execution. Closing a leaf does not close its umbrella until every mapped acceptance is integrated.
- A leaf starts from its GitHub issue, [`UNIT-CONTRACT.md`](05_delivery_replan/output/UNIT-CONTRACT.md), relevant card, linked PRD/ADRs, and current resume capsule—not the superseded whole-v1 goal.
- Schema, root routes, CLI registration, injected UI/service worker, dependency files, generated screenshots, release/deployment state, root docs, and `agents/` are serialized unless the controller records concrete non-overlap.
- Every campaign ends with integration evidence or an MWP pause capsule. `execution-active` is forbidden when no controller is running.

## Credential-Ready Terminal Boundary

Before live credentials are requested, the repository must have reviewed app/CLI artifacts, production-shaped local rehearsal, credential-free plan, fake-provider apply/resume/deploy/doctor evidence, complete example/screenshots/docs, clean-clone proof, holistic trust audit, and one exact Operator-run ceremony.

The Operator supplies provider accounts/domain, region/plan choices, billing/legal acceptance, and least-privilege credentials only through the direct safe ingress. The setup program creates/updates namespaced manifest resources, configures secrets/DNS/TLS/processes, migrates, waits for health, and emits redacted doctor/smoke status. Credential absence may leave a truthful credential-ready repository; it cannot be represented as a live smoke.

## Authority Envelope

Chris has authorized a top-level controller to continue without routine approval through decomposition, GitHub coordination, implementation, review, repair, documentation, packaging, and deployment preparation of the accepted PRD. The controller may choose reversible implementation details and fix ordinary failures inside the declared campaign.

Within this repository and GitHub project, the controller may create/edit/move/remove recoverable project files; install/run project dependencies/services/tests/browsers/build/security tools; manage issues/labels/branches/commits/PRs/releases/packages/deployment configuration; merge reviewed green leaf PRs; and prepare or apply the documented reference deployment using safely supplied credentials when the runtime can keep values out of model/tool logs.

The controller stops for missing external authority/input at the live boundary; irreversible/destructive existing-resource action without proven recovery; paid/legal/account/domain commitment; a required change to the trust promise, accepted ADR, MIT/public/single-Owner/invite-only/reference-provider scope; or a persistent third-party blocker after safe alternatives. It may not weaken security, expose credentials/private content/Viewer PII, add proprietary product dependencies, contact real Viewers, charge for services, or delete existing production resources merely for expedience.

## Promotion Rule

Stage 05 promotes only after local graph review, full PRD coverage, GitHub leaf publication, umbrella reconciliation, one accurate frontier, and agreement between this file and the tracker. Product execution resumes in a fresh context; this replan controller does not silently continue into U01 implementation.

## Limitations

- Current provider APIs, capabilities, plan choices, and official deployment guidance must be reverified from primary provider documentation inside U04/U31/U32.
- Only macOS arm64 has exercised the frozen dependency/tool bootstrap so far; artifact/platform claims remain unverified until U28–U30.
- Live Northflank, PlanetScale, Cloudflare R2, DNS, and GitHub credentials are deliberately absent from all current evidence.
- The public demonstration remains a synthetic invite-only Site; anonymous public Sites stay outside v1.
